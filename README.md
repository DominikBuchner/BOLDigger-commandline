    ie_its              ITS identification engine
    ie_rbcl             rbcl identification engine
    add_metadata        additional data download
    first_hit           use the first hit as top hit
    jamp_hit            determine the top hit with the JAMP method
    digger_hit          determine the top hit with the BOLDigger method

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

                              [batch_size]

positional arguments:
  username       Username for boldsystems login
  password       Password for boldsystems login
  fasta_path     Path to the fasta file to be blasted
  output_folder  Path to the output folder
  batch_size     Batch size to be blasted.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
```
